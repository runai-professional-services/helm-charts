those resources when making an API call.

7. Modify the `prod-values.yaml`, make sure to update the following fields: The clientID and
clientSecret are the credentials from the `application` you created in step 5.

credentials:
  clientId: "<name-of-application>"
  clientSecret: "<seceret-generated-on-creation>"
  baseUrl: "<base-url-to-runai>"

  # Define how often the metrics job is ran. Default is every midnight.
  schedule: "0 0 * * *"
```
